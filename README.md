# Doomlike Engine Map Editor
A simple but powerfull map editor for my [doomlike raycasting engine.](https://github.com/vitor-luis3301/Doomlike-engine-in-C).

It's written in C++ and it uses the [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library to create the UI,

Alongside SDL2 for the window handeling and everything else.
